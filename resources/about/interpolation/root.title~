<h1>Interpolation Reference</h1>
<p>Each HTML widget has the ability to access dynamic framework apis and constants.<br />
To use this functionality simply wrap your commands in {{ }}, the framework will parse and output the result of the command.<br />
Exceptions thrown in these blocks are caught and output in JSON format without interupting generation of the website.</p>
<h2>APIs</h2>
<p>This is a list of command APIs and their classes, the syntax is as follows:<br />
{{ClassName::Method(Arguments)}}</p>
<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" border="1"><tr><th>Class Name</th><th>Method</th><th>Arguments</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>ModifiedImage</td><td>scaledURI</td><td>file, width, height</td><td>Returns a the URI of a scaled copy of the file specified.<br /><small>Throws an exception if the image format is not supported or the file is not readable.</small></tr>
<tr><td>ModifiedImage</td><td>scaledTransparentURI</td><td>file, width, height</td><td>Produces the same result as scaledURI, except that it supports alpha blending.</tr></table>
